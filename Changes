    - Worked around 5.018 madness

    - Reverted to previous behaviour.
      The workaround was ineffective in some cases
      and the problem appears to be an actual bug
      with lexical scoping inside closures in Perl 5.18.

    - Found new workaround for 5.018 incompatibility.
      "Problem" appears to be a deliberate choice by P5P
      when optimizing the implementation of closures.
      New solution is actually superior to original
      (pre-5.18) solution, as it does not require
      PadWalker, and hence is unlikely to break on
      future changes in implementation.
